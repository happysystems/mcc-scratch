# Hey!
It looks like you're in the **archives** folder!
Here, you can find old versions of [‚òÅ] Multiplayer Cookie Clicker, or MCC!

# How are these useful?
If you like the older version of MCC, you can get the exact version you want. It's as easy as making a [README.MD](https://github.com/happysystems/mcc-scratch/blob/main/Archives/README.md)!
